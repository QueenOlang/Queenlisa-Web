                            What I wouldn't give to spend all night awake with you again, filling the hours with unnecessary activities just to spend more time with each other. 
                            To spend all day holding each other. I have never had a boring day with you. 
                            I was just thinking about our midnight food runs and it has me so sad. I miss racing bikes with you and you cheating by always trying to be on the inside. 
                            I miss being indecisive about what food to get at lawson's and ending up buying nonsense. I miss how you'd put your hand in my back pocket when we walk sometimes.
                            I miss how we were convincing ourselves that we were being slick when we were acting like a full-blown couple everywhere. 
                            I miss our coffee dates. I miss our playing pool dates. I miss going to Lugas and doing the most knowing we can't eat all that.
                            I miss every moment we spent together and I wish I could relive it.
                            <span style="color: red;">I LOVE YOU</span>  so, very, incredibly much.
                        </p>
